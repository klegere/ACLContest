ACLContest
==========

This ACL project is an example of how you can export to excel and use the EXECUTE 
command to call a visual basic script to copy an excel macro to your exported 
file.

Requirements: 
1. An ACL Table to Export
2. An Excel Macro in external .xlsm file

To update the script to run on your ACL table and Excel macro simply update the 
table name in the ACL script and the path/filename in the .vbs file. You can
use Notepad to update and save the .vbs file.
